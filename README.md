Default files for [@doocs](https://github.com/doocs) repositories.

GitHub will use and display default files for any public repository in the [@doocs](https://github.com/doocs) organization that does not have its own file of that type in any of the following places:

- the root of the repository
- the `.github` folder
- the `docs` folder

The files are not included in `clones`, `packages`, or `downloads` of individual repositories because they are stored only in the `.github` repository.

Supported file types:

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`: A CODE_OF_CONDUCT file defines standards for how to engage in a community.
- `CONTRIBUTING`: A CONTRIBUTING file communicates how people should contribute to your project.
- `FUNDING`: A FUNDING file displays a sponsor button in your repository to increase the visibility of funding options for your open source project. 
- `Issue and pull request templates`: Issue and pull request templates customize and standardize the information you'd like contributors to include when they open issues and pull requests in your repository. 
- `SECURITY`: 	A SECURITY file gives instructions for how to responsibly report a security vulnerability in your project.
- `SUPPORT`: A SUPPORT file lets people know about ways to get help with your project.
