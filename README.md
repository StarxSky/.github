- `CONTRIBUTING`: A CONTRIBUTING file communicates how people should contribute to your project.
- `FUNDING`: A FUNDING file displays a sponsor button in your repository to increase the visibility of funding options for your open source project. 
- `Issue and pull request templates`: Issue and pull request templates customize and standardize the information you'd like contributors to include when they open issues and pull requests in your repository. 
- `SECURITY`: 	A SECURITY file gives instructions for how to responsibly report a security vulnerability in your project.
